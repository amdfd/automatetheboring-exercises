 Exercises from the book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python

 - This week I started reviewing the basics and wrote a little program to practice asking for input, printing information, and transforming integers into strings. I also reviewed flow control and functions and took on the challenges of writing a guessing game (using for loops and conditions), a magic 8 ball game (functions and conditions), Rock, Paper, Scissors (while loop and conditions), and finally a program to create and demonstrate the Collatz Sequence (functions, conditions, try and except).
 - I feel like understanding the logic is easier than writing the code itself. Despite being able to comprehend what I had to do on the challenges, I found it hard to organize my thoughts so I could decide where to start. I believe practice makes perfect (or at least usable, lol), so I'm eager to see where the challenges will take me.
